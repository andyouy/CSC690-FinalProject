# CSC690-FinalProject

## Project Proposal
For my final project I decided to create a simple translation app. I know that the app idea is very simple, but I hope to add features to make it easier for users pick up and learn new languages. 

## Run Instructions
  1. Clone the repo onto your local machine 
  2. Please make sure to open the workspace file and not the xcode file

## Features
Must have features:
  - Pick two languages to translate between
  - Flashcards that allow the user the study the language they are interested in

Extra features:
  - Text to speech for the text that gets translated so users can hear how the words are pronounced
  - Users can add their own flashcards to the current decks
  - Users can create new decks of flashcards

Features completed on the App:
  - Users can pick two different languages to translate between
  - Users can view the pre-created decks of flashcards to help study and review

Unfortunately, I was unable to implement the extra features I wanted in the app because of time constraints.
